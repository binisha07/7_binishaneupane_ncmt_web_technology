Chapter 1: An Overview of the Internet and the Web

Group A: Short Questions
1.Define the term "Protocol" in the context of the internet.
=>In the context of the internet, the term "protocol" is a set of rules and procedures
  outlining how connected devices communicate over the internet to exchange easily
  and safely.

2. What is the primary difference between Web Browser and a Search Engine?
=>The primary difference between Web Browser and Search Engine is:
  Web browser is an application used to access and view web pages stored on web 
  servers.And search engine is a software system that allows users to find the
  information on the internet.

3.Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
=>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interconnected webpages and information 
 that can be accessed using the internet. It enables content sharing over the internet.

4.Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
=> Static web page is simple to build, primarily using client-side languages like HTML,
  CSS and basic JavaScript but Dynamic web page is more complex requiring server-side
  scripting language like PHP, Python and databases.

Group B: Long Questions 
5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
=> The client-server architecture of the web is a fundamental computing model where
  tasks and workloads are distributed between a client (who requests for a service)
  and a server (the service provider) across a network, following a request-response 
  pattern.

  The user performs an actdion for example, typing a URL into a browser, clicking a 
  link, sending an email etc which triggers the client to send a request to the server 
  which is also termed as request initiation stage. The request, typically an HTTP message 
  travels over the internet to the server's IP address, often after a Domain Name System (DNS)
  which translates the domain name to an IP address. The server receives the request, processes
  it and prepares a response.The server sends the requested data or a status message back to
  the client. The client receives the response and renders it for the user to view and 
  interact with.Some real-world examples of client-server architecture are web browsing,
  email, online banking etc.

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
=> The fuctions of the internet services of Email, FTP, and VoIP are:
  Email: The main function of email is creating, sending, receiving and managing electronic
  messages. It supports creating messages with text, formatting and attachments (documents,
  images, etc). Moving emails between sender and receiver using servers and protocols like 
  SMTP for sending and POP3/IMAP for receiving is also the function of email.

  FTP: The primary function of FTP (File Trasfer Protocol) is the reliable transfer of files
  between a client and a server. Beyond the simple function of moving files the other
  functions of FTP are file and directory management, user authentication and access control,
  platform compatibility, data sharing and collaboration and data backup and recovery.

  VoIP: The function of VoIP is converting analog voice into digital data packets, sends them
  via IP and convert them back into sound. Making calls from computers smartphones, tablets 
  or dedicated VoIP phones is also the function of VoIP. 

7. "The internet is a network of networks." Elaborate on this statement explaining how
packet switching works.
=> The statement "the internet is a network of networks" describes its architecture as
  decentralized collection of interconnected smaller networks such as local area 
  networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs) and individual home networks. These networks
  link together through various devices, like routers and switches. 
  Data trasmission across this infrastructure uses a method called paket switching. This 
  technology breaks down messages into small, manageable data units called packets and sends
  them independently across the network. When a user sends data, the message is divided into 
  smaller, fixed-sized packets. Each packet is tagged with a header containing the sender's 
  and receiver's IP addresses. The packets are then injected into a network. Each packet is 
  routed independently taking different paths based on network congestion or efficiency.At 
  the destination the receiver collects all the packets. It uses the sequence numbers in 
  the header to reassemble them into the original complete message. The final stage is
  verification, the receiving system checks for error-checking information. If any packets 
  are missing or corrupted, the recipient can request retransmission from sender to ensure
  data integrity.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. A startup company wnats to host a website that displays the same information to all
visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use 
a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
=> I would not agree with the advise to use a dynamic website. For specific usecase,
a static website is the best choice. Static website displays the same information to 
all the visitors. On the other side, dynamic website is designed to change content 
based on user interaction, time or database queries.Since the startup doesn't
need personalization, a dynamic site is unnecessary. Static website requires very low 
maintenance costs but dynamic website requires high maintenance costs which should
update the Content Management System (CMS), manage the database, and ensure the server 
environment is secure from SQL injections or other vulnerabilities. Static websites 
can be hosted for very cheap as they require minimal server resources. Static websites are 
faster because the server doesn't have to build the page from a database every time someone 
clicks a link.
So, advising a dynamic website introduces unnecessary technical debt, higher hosting costs,
and security risks for a company that only needs to display fixed information.

9. A user type www.google.com into their browser but the browser displays a "Server not
Found" error even though the internet connection is active. However, acessing the site via
142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that 
failed.
=> The problem is a failure in the DomainName System (DNS) resolution. Since the site loads 
when using the IP address, we know the web server is online and the internet connection is 
working. The "Server Not Found" error appearing only for the URL indicates that the 
browser cannot translate the human-readable name into the machine-readable IP address.

DNS maps domain names to IP addresses. When a user types a URL, the computer sends 
a request to DNS Resolver.The resolver searches through a hierarchy of servers to 
find the correct IP address associated with that name.In this scenario the link is broken.
This could be due to misconfigured DNS settings on the user's computer. A failure at the
internet service provider's(ISP) Dns service may be the problem. An issue with the
website's own DNS records may also be the problem behind the given scenario.

10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensiitve inventory data with specific 
suppliers but doen't want this information available to the general public. Explain 
which network type (Intranet, Extranet or Internet) they should implement and why?
=> A multinational corporation should implement an Extranet network type. 
An internet is strictly for internal employees. While it is secure, it would not allow the 
specific suppliersto access the inventory data. The internet is a global network.Since the 
corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data and doen't want it available to the
general public the public internet is too insecure for this purpose. An extranet acts as a 
private extension of an internet. It uses firewalls and security protocols to allow 
authorized external users like suppliers to access a limited part of the corporation's 
internal network without exposing it to everyone on the internet.So, the corporation 
should implement an extranet. This is the best choice because an extranet allows a company 
to securely share internal information with authorized external suppliers while maintaining
a firewall to keep data hidden from the general public.It provides the necessary balance
between the total privacy of an intranet and the total openness of the inetrnet.
