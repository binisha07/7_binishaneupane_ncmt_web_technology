# Chapter 2: Website Development Process
## Group A: Short Questions
### 1. Define the term "Sitemap" in the planning phase.
### => The term "Sitemap" in the planning phase is a visual blueprint or structured outline of a website's entire content and hierarchy. It defines scope, organization, and navigation of the site before design and coding begin.

### 2. What is the purpose of the "Launch" phase in web development?
### => The purpose of the "Launch" phase in web development is to transit the completed website from a private development environment to a live-facing public platform ensuring data migration, server setup and configuration, code merge, and sanity tests.

### 3. Why is "Documentation" important in the development lifecycle?
### => "Documentation' is important in the dvelopment lifecycle because it ensures clarity, consistency, and continuity, guides teams from requirements to maintenance, enables smooth collaboration, reduces errors and provides base for future updates.

### 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
### => Front-end development builds the interactive parts or a website(UI/UX) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React while back-end development creates the server side logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, Java and databases.

## Group B: Long Questions
### 5."Planning is the most critical phase of web development." Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
### => Planning is the most critical phase of web development. This statement is correct as proper planning ensures all requirements are understood, resources are allocated efficiently, and potential risks are mitigated before development begins. Key activities performed during the planning phase are listed below:
### a. Defining project scope and objectives.
### b. Gathering and documenting detailed requirements from stakeholders.
### c. Creating a project timeline and setting turning point.
### d. Allocating resources (team members, budget, tools).
### e. Conducting risk assement and developing mitigation plans.
### f. Defining the project's technical specifications and architecture.

### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly finished?
### => The maintenace phase is iterative because websites require continuous updates, bug fixes, security patches, and new feature additions to remain relevant and functional. A website is never truly A website is never truly finished because the digital landscape is constantly evolving. This includes technological advancements like new programming languages, frameworks, and devices emerge, requiring updates to ensure compatibility and leverage new capabilities. New vulnerabilities are constantly discovered, it is neccessary for regular security patches and updates to protect user data and maintain integrity.User feedback and evolving needs is also the most importaant part. User expectations and business requirements change over time, leading to requests for new features, design tweaks, and content updates. Content management should be done time to time. Information needs regular updating, adding, or removal to keep it current and engaging for visitors.Search engine optimization (SE0) is necessary for increasing the flow of visitors on websites. Algorithms for search engines change frequently, requiring continuous adjustments to ensure the website remains visible and competitive. So, website is never truly finished.

### 7. Describe the process of "Information Gathering." Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
### => Information Gathering is the foundational stage in web development where research is done for the project's purpose, and goals,  the target audience, defining who the site serves, why they'd visit, and what they need, making it crucial for tailoring design, content, and functionality to meet user expectations, ensure usability, and achieve business objectives like sales or brand engagement, preventing wasted effort on irrelevant features.  Knowing the audience helps design intuitive navigation, relevant features, and appealing visuals that match their preferences and tech savviness.
