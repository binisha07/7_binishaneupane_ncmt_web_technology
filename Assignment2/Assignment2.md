# Chapter 2: Website Development Process
## Group A: Short Questions
### 1. Define the term "Sitemap" in the planning phase.
### => The term "Sitemap" in the planning phase is a visual blueprint or structured outline of a website's entire content and hierarchy. It defines scope, organization, and navigation of the site before design and coding begin.

### 2. What is the purpose of the "Launch" phase in web development?
### => The purpose of the "Launch" phase in web development is to transit the completed website from a private development environment to a live-facing public platform ensuring data migration, server setup and configuration, code merge, and sanity tests.

### 3. Why is "Documentation" important in the development lifecycle?
### => "Documentation' is important in the dvelopment lifecycle because it ensures clarity, consistency, and continuity, guides teams from requirements to maintenance, enables smooth collaboration, reduces errors and provides base for future updates.

### 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
### => Front-end development builds the interactive parts or a website(UI/UX) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React while back-end development creates the server side logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, Java and databases.

## Group B: Long Questions
### 5."Planning is the most critical phase of web development." Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
### => Planning is the most critical phase of web development. This statement is correct as proper planning ensures all requirements are understood, resources are allocated efficiently, and potential risks are mitigated before development begins. Key activities performed during the planning phase are listed below:
### a. Defining project scope and objectives.
### b. Gathering and documenting detailed requirements from stakeholders.
### c. Creating a project timeline and setting turning point.
### d. Allocating resources (team members, budget, tools).
### e. Conducting risk assement and developing mitigation plans.
### f. Defining the project's technical specifications and architecture.

### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly finished?
### => The maintenace phase is iterative because websites require continuous updates, bug fixes, security patches, and new feature additions to remain relevant and functional. A website is never truly A website is never truly finished because the digital landscape is constantly evolving. This includes technological advancements like new programming languages, frameworks, and devices emerge, requiring updates to ensure compatibility and leverage new capabilities. New vulnerabilities are constantly discovered, it is neccessary for regular security patches and updates to protect user data and maintain integrity.User feedback and evolving needs is also the most importaant part. User expectations and business requirements change over time, leading to requests for new features, design tweaks, and content updates. Content management should be done time to time. Information needs regular updating, adding, or removal to keep it current and engaging for visitors.Search engine optimization (SE0) is necessary for increasing the flow of visitors on websites. Algorithms for search engines change frequently, requiring continuous adjustments to ensure the website remains visible and competitive. So, website is never truly finished.

### 7. Describe the process of "Information Gathering." Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
### => Information Gathering is the foundational stage in web development where research is done for the project's purpose, and goals,  the target audience, defining who the site serves, why they'd visit, and what they need, making it crucial for tailoring design, content, and functionality to meet user expectations, ensure usability, and achieve business objectives like sales or brand engagement, preventing wasted effort on irrelevant features.  Knowing the audience helps design intuitive navigation, relevant features, and appealing visuals that match their preferences and tech knowledge.  Content strategy guides the creation of valuable, engaging content that addresses user needs and questions, improving SEO and relevance. A user-centric site is more likely to convert visitors into customers or subscribers as it directly solves their problems. Prevents costly redesigns or adding features later that weren't planned for the actual users, ensuring development efficiency.

## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
### 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the "Testing" phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaning the potential risks (security, functionality, capability) of skipping this phase.
### => Lunching a website by skipping the testing phase is one the worst decisions. The potential risks of skipping the testing phase are given below:
### a. Security Vulnerabilities: In e-commerce, trust is the primary currency. Without a dedicated security testing phase, if we leave the site open it may result to data breaches. Vulnerabilities in the codebase could expose customer names, addresses, and credit card information.

### b. Functionality Problem: A functional site on a developer's machine rarely behaves the same way in the user's side. Testing ensures the user journey is seamless. There may arise a problem of broken checkout. If a bug prevents a customer from adding a discount code or completing a payment, they won't report it, they’ll simply leave for a competitor. The site might look great on a desktop but be completely unusable on specific iPhone or Android browsers.

### c. Scalability & Capability Risks: We want the launch to be a success, but success brings traffic. Without "Load and Stress Testing," we don't know the site's breaking point. If the marketing campaign is successful and 1,000 people visit at once, an untested server architecture could crash, leading to a total loss of sales during the most critical moment. Without testing the logic between the storefront and the database, there is risk of "overselling" items which are not available in stock, leading to a customer service nightmare.

### 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
### =>The developer failed to follow a structured software development methodology, specifically omitting the critical planning and design phases where client collaboration and approval are essential. The developer's primary mistake was starting the implementation before defining the requirements and design with the client. This "code first" approach meant there was no shared understanding or documented agreement of the final product, leading to a mismatch in expectations and the client's rejection of the layout. It should have been handled by:
### a. Requirements Gathering: Conduct detailed meetings to understand the client's vision, target audience, and functional needs.
### b. Planning and Design: Create a sitemap and a design prototype or wireframe.
### c. Client Approval: Present the sitemap and prototype to the client for feedback and formal sign-off before writing any significant code.

### 10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedule were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
### =>The phase of the development lifecycle that was neglected is the maintenance phase. This phase is critical because it addresses issues that arise after the product has been deployed and is being used by customers. Activities involved in the maintenance phase are:
### a. Bug fixes: Correcting errors or defects discovered after deployment.
### b. Updates: Providing new features, security patches, or content updates (like updating the exam schedule in this case).
### c. Performance enhancements: Optimizing the system for better speed, efficiency, or user experience.
### d. Documentation updates: Ensuring all related documentation reflects the current state of the system.
